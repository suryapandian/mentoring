    welcome: `Hello RIT 🎉

I'm excited to connect with you all and share experiences, insights, and learnings from my journey in software engineering.
Even more excited to hear what motivates you, keeps you going and learn from you as well!

This is an open floor – anything goes! Whether you want to discuss:
• Tech trends, system design, or coding practices
• Career growth and professional development
• Travel stories and life experiences
• Or anything else on your mind

Please suggest topics you'd like to talk about. I'm here to help and happy to dive into whatever interests you. Looking forward to our conversations!`,
